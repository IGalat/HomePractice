We've got a blog with articles and comments to articles. This is a CRUD REST with cascade deleting of corresponding comments

# Filename data.sql, if exists, gets executed at start, after table creations; any other name won't work

cascade deleting via annotations in Comment class;

interface ArticleStats in Article(and in repo) allows to get only certain fields;

when serializing to json, comment will show articleId - also via annonations in Comment
(if we want to show more than id, gotta make Projection(like with ArticleStats))

For transactions:
 - in Launcher @EnableTransactionManagement
 - in Service or wherever @Transactional over class(for all methods) or over method
   (if over both, the config on the method one override config of class: readOnly, and other @ options)

Db is persisted through application.properties and is saved in spring-boot-h2-db.mv.db
